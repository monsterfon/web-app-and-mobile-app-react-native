# Web App and Mobile App React Native

This project includes two distinct applications: a **Web App** built with **JavaScript** and **Processing** for data visualization, and a **Mobile App** developed with **React Native** for tracking personal experiences in a timeline format.

## Web App: Startup Success Data Visualization

The web app is built in **JavaScript** and uses the open-source **Processing** library for data visualization. The app visualizes the success rates of startups across different industries, with a focus on the **IT field**. 

### Key Features:
- **Data Visualization**: The app presents data on startup success rates and acquisition trends in various industries.
- **Focus on IT Startups**: It identifies that IT startups are highly successful and frequently acquiredâ€”**about 10% of the time**.
- **Career Insight**: Based on the data, it suggests that working in IT startups could be a potentially lucrative career path.

The web app is a **local host** application, which runs directly on your PC using **Processing**. The project was developed for personal insight into the startup landscape, helping individuals make informed decisions about career choices in the startup world.

### Technologies Used:
- **JavaScript** for the main logic.
- **Processing** for open-source graphics and data visualization.

## Mobile App: Timeline (Experience Tracker)

The mobile app, called **Timeline**, is developed with **React Native** using **ExpoBuild**. The app helps users track their personal experiences in the form of a timeline. 

### Key Features:
- **Experience Logging**: Users can log their experiences, and the app organizes them in a timeline format.
- **Personal Diary**: It acts like a digital diary where users can reflect on and store their memories and experiences.
- **Timeline View**: The app provides a visually appealing timeline that helps users review and revisit past experiences in chronological order.

The app is designed to be a simple yet effective way for users to preserve memories and experiences over time.

### Technologies Used:
- **React Native** for mobile app development.
- **ExpoBuild** for app bundling and building.

## How to Run

### Web App:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the JavaScript code locally with **Processing** on your machine.
3. Open the app in your browser to view the data visualization.

### Mobile App:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use **Expo** to run the app on your mobile device or emulator.
